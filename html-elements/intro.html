            Hi, I'm Trevor,
        </h2>
        <p>
            I’m an award-winning machine learning researcher with a growing focus on learning-based perception
            and decision systems for autonomous robots. With a strong foundation in software engineering and applied ML, 
            I build systems that are tested on real hardware and constrained by real-world failure modes. 
            I’m driven to develop scalable, safety-critical systems that learn through interaction and make autonomy 
            practical, not brittle.
